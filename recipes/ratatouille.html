    <!--DESCRIPTION-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is one that my Aunt Deby taught me how to make from her Italian family.
        <br>It utilizes fresh late summer vegetables, such as tomato, squash, and bell pepper. 
    </p>
    <p>This recipe was popularized in my generation by the Disney movie, Ratatouille.
        <br>Canonically, a rat named Remy becomes a secret head chef at a has-been fine-dining restaurant.
